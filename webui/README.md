# strategic-review-webui

Web UI server for reviewing strategic reports stored in `.strategic/` directory.

## Dependency: strategic-review Skill

This package is designed to work **in conjunction with the [`strategic-review` skill](https://github.com/kanghohyeong/strategic-review-skill)**.

The `strategic-review` skill (and its companion `strategic-review-interactive` skill) instructs the Claude Code agent to save strategic review reports as `.md` files under the `.strategic/` directory in your project. This web UI reads those files and presents them in a browser-based interface.

**Without the skill installed, the agent will not generate reports, and this UI will have no content to display.**

### Recommended Setup

1. Install the skill:
   ```bash
   npx skills add https://github.com/kanghohyeong/strategic-review-skill --skill strategic-review-interactive
   ```

2. Run this web UI in your project directory:
   ```bash
   npx -y strategic-review-webui -- --port 3131
   ```

3. Ask the agent to perform a strategic review — it will save the report to `.strategic/`, which you can then browse in the UI.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g strategic-review-webui

Or with a custom port:

Then open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## npx (no installation)

```bash
npx strategic-review-webui

## Requirements
